SBAOFC.py is a python program written by Elliott "Eight" I.
This program will use user input to create the nececcery files needed by "Starbound" for the object to be added to the game.
You will still need to move the images to the right folder, I haven't finished that yet

SB Pre-release:
Since SB has not been released, the object's folder and "/assets/items/object" folder will be placed in the same directory(folder) that the program is in.

When SB has been released, the files will be placed directly into the appropriate folder(s)
