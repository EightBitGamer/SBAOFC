How to install:
  -Pake sure you have python installed on your computer.
  -Place "SBAOFC.py" in an empty folder (doesn't matter where)

To add images:
  -when you are asked for an image, drag the image into the window, this should add the images filePath

SB Pre-release:
Since SB has not been released, the object's folder and "/assets/items/object" folder will be placed in the same directory(folder) that the program is in.

When SB has been released, the files will be placed directly into the appropriate folder(s)

A pre-made image "sewergear.png" (from the tutorial on the starbound forum)  is included to demonstrate how pre-made images are saved
