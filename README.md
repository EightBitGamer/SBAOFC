SB Animated object files creator

SBAOFC.py is a python program written by "Eight" (see Lisence.md for sharing,editing permisions)
This program (SBAOFC.py) will use user input (via a terminal window) to create the nececcery files needed by "Starbound" for the object to be added to the game ("Starbound").

SB Pre-release:
Since SB has not been released, the object's folder(s) and "/assets/items/object" folder will be placed in the same directory(folder) that the program is in.


When SB has been released, and the program is updated, the files will be placed directly into the appropriate folders
